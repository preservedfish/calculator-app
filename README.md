# Calculator App

A calculator app built using React and Firebase. The last 10 calculations are displayed and synced among users. The calculator supports basic Javascript arithmetic, `+, -, *, **, /, %`.

## To-Dos
Functionality-wise the program successfully performs calculations and displays the 10 most recent ones in descending order. There are a few more things to do, however:

1. Implement tests using Jest
1. Make a production build and deploy it
